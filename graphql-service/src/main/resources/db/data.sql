The undeniable fact is that this type of chair was one of the first in the former USSR and the first in western Ukraine. Founder (on the initiative of the rector of Lviv University Academic Eugene Lazarenko) and the long head of the department was Professor A. Kostovskyy.

The Department formed a scientific field of problems of mathematical and computer modeling and optimization of physical – mechanical fields in solid environment. This research area is based on the scientific achievements of professors N. P. Fleyshman and Ya. H. Savula and their students. The modern period of Departments functionality under Professor Ya. H. Savula direction studies characterized variation- projection methods, finite and boundary elements and their application to the analysis and optimal management of physical – mechanical fields. Scientific work is being held on the Department in the field of numerical modeling of solutions of applied problems of different nature from heterogeneous mathematical models and using hybrid schemes of finite and boundary elements methods, in the numerical analysis of nonlinear problems of mathematical physics with application to shell theory, the theory of plasticity and to modeling of transport processes plasma.

This comparatevely short period of time was highly productive, in particular, for the development of topology in Lviv due to the contribution of several brilliant Polish topologists such as Waclaw Sierpiriski, Kazimierz Kuratowski, Zygmunt Janiszewski, Bronistaw Knaster, Juliusz P. Schauder. To a great extent, the activity of the Lviv mathematical school was interrupted by the dramatic events of the WWII, which changed the whole infrastructure of the mathematical science in Lviv. This historic period marked the end of the Lviv phenomenon as a branch of Polish mathematical school and also a point of discontinuity of topological investigations in Lviv (perhaps the only topologist working in Lviv during the post-war years was Myron Zaryts’kyi (Zarycki); some of his results concerning operations on sets in topological spaces were cited in “Topology” by K. Kuratowski).'),
